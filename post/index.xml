      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are concerned and stan together over the alarming and disturbing rate of murders of black and browns skin men, woman and children in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is showing this country and the world our diversity history pride and unity! That&amp;rsquo;s we stand aware strong united worthy of a life and worth fighting for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not only making history we are creating our own new history at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this has ever been done before on this scale ever. We will have images being posted from all over the country maybe the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we ask is that your subjects are photographed in the united tank tops and we can see the united logo so everyone will know that your images are supporting and part of the art project united exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use your creativity imagination and freedom of expression to create your vision, be creatively ambitious and fearless!&lt;/p&gt;
